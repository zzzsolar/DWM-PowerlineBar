# DWM-PowerlineBar
Simple shell script that displays the battery power, uptime, and the current date and time in a powerline theme. Runs on DWM or Nimdow or any other tiling window manager that uses xsetroot.

Make sure that Hack Nerd Fonts, ACPI, and Curl is installed. As this script will not run properly without them.![2022-08-07_10-48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110750401/183296738-6c8e5559-4f34-4e95-a4d0-c783660397c3.png)
